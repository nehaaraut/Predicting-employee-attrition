# Predicting-employee-attrition
Our hypothetical company wants to apply data science principles and steps to deal with a critical HR issue: employee churn. It realizes that when good people leave, it costs far more to replace them than providing them with some incentives to keep them. So, it would like to be data-driven in the HR decisions it makes with respect to employee retention. This project aims to predict if an employee is going to resign or not.

I have used a dataset put up by IBM for our analysis. The dataset contains 35 variables along with Attrition variable.
This dataset was produced by IBM and has just under 1470 observations of 35 different variables including Attrition, Employee Number, Employee Count, Standard Hours, Education, Education Level etc.

Classification algorithm such as decision tree, boosting, regression etc. can be used to interpret the data. 
1. Through our analysis we intend to build a model which can predict if an employee is about to quit. 
2. We shall be looking at all variables through some plots and infer about it in our exploratory analysis. 
3. After our exploration we shall build some features based on the Variables at hand and take a call on inclusion/exclusion of few variables.
